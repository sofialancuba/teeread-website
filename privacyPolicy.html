We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent.

                                    <p class="mb-2">When we do collect Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we do so with the consent of the child’s parent, guardian, or another person with such authority (collectively, the child’s “Parent”).

Based on this information, we assign unique, alphanumeric codes for each individual child. Except for the individual child codes, which are autogenerated by TeeRead, all Personal Information is collected through the Services, either through direct input by the parent or teacher, or directly from the child, such as the audio files.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-2">We only collect children’s Personal Information as is reasonably necessary to appropriately provide our Services. We only retain children’s Personal Information for as long as is necessary to provide our Services. When it is no longer necessary, such as when the Services are concluded, the Personal Information is deleted.</p>

You may also review what Personal Information we have collected on or from your child at any time upon request. You can instruct TeeRead to delete your child’s Personal Information at any time, or withdraw your previously given consent for the further collection or use of your child’s Personal Information.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-2">Likewise, you always have the choice whether or not to provide any other Personal Information to TeeRead. As indicated above, some of our Services require that you register with TeeRead but doing so is at your discretion. If you choose not to provide required Personal Information, you can still use any portion of our Services that do not require Personal Information.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-2">If you do provide us with Personal Information, we want to make sure it remains accurate and up to date. You can use the tools that we make available through our Services to modify or remove certain information related to your Account. If you need to correct or update any other part(s) of your child’s or your own Personal Information, you can submit a change request directly to TeeRead by emailing us at <a href="mailto:trini@teeread.com">trini@teeread.com</a>.
